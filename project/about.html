                    BMS Online Institute was founded on the principle of EDUCATION WITHOUT BOUNDARIES. It was borne out of the fact that millions of Africans have no basic secondary education basically because of unavailability of affordable quality schools. BMS was founded in the year 2024 and the founder of BMS Online Institute is Dr. Maxwell Balla Nvani, a renowned Dentist. The current principal, Vice principal - admin and Vice principal - Academics of the school are Dr. Gloria Okpah, Dr. Larry Nvani and Mr. Pax Nvani respectively

                <p class="about-sec-p">The school comprises a 2 year program. First year is targeted at conventional SS1 curriculum and part of SS2 curriculum. Second year consists of the remainder of the SS2 curriculum and SS3 curriculum. Subjects would span both arts and science. Students also have the option of choosing one skill to learn ranging from Baking, Sewing, Knitting, Shoe making, etc.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Each day is structured to start from 8am to 4pm excluding Saturdays and sundays. There would be morning gathering sessions between students in a class and an instructor which would be a live video session. Here, students would have the opportunity to talk about anything bothering him/her. They would also be emotionally and spiritually encouraged.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Each day aside Saturday and Sunday, one major subject would be taught with an accompanying post-lecture test since each student would have 5 major courses to concentrate on. Minor subjects would also be taught appropriately. There would be end of week assessments and end of term (after 3 months) examination.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Each student would be provided with a customized tablet device. These tablets would automatically become theirs at the end of the program. We also offer scholarships to outstanding students in the second year of the program and we also cater for the WAEC Registration fees for outstanding students at the end of the program.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Parents would be emailed the performance of his/her child including attendance to gathering and classes, post-lecture tests and end of term exams. Saturdays, from 7am to 8am would be for sporting activities. Please note that the manner of teaching is via customized videos with enough and elaborate demonstrations, explanations and diagrams. These videos are made by qualified persons with degrees in the respective fields.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Students would be responsible for registering for the WAEC NOV-DEC Exams. However, they would be guided. There would also be room for a JAN-FEB exam if they do not pass the NOV-DEC exams. We also offer A-level curriculum for 3 major courses.</p>
                <p class="about-sec-p">Students would be responsible for traveling to the designated exam centers for the examinations. Our fee structure is flexible. Parents have the option of paying 6-monthly. Also, we have endeavored to make this school very affordable and convenient. You donâ€™t need to worry about security or transportation cost as your children would be taught everything right from home.</p>
